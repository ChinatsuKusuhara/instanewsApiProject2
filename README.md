#InstaNews API 

This is my second project in the Web Dev course at Red Academy the purpose of this project was to build a responsive one page website that uses the New York Times API to show 12 news stories with Images.

Technologies Used
  HTML5
  CSS3 and SAAS
  Javascript and Jquery
  Gulp
  JSONP
  Node Package Module
  Lint

 Personal Learnings: This was the first time I have used SAAS and setting variables let me easily change the font styling. Using gulp to set up browser-synch help me to see the effect of changes immediately. I am learning and practicing the implementation of all of the technologies used above.
